# OPy Config
 A lightweight script used to create logging parameters for data logging through CSV files
 
 This should be easier to use and get started with compared to Speep's Haskell version as not everyone is fluent with computers. All you need is to install Python from [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/) link 

 Just make sure to download version 3.10 or newer.

 **How to use:**
 * As I have a windows machine only I have the steps to make this easiest on windows. This will still run on Mac and other operating systems that can run python.
 * Make sure to keep the CSV PID Master sheet in the same directory as the python script
 * Put an "x" into the first column of whatever parameter you would like to take a log of in the PID spreadsheet
 * In the search bar of windows explorer in the directory of the scripts, type CMD, then press enter.
 * Either type `py OPy-Config.py`, `python OPy-Config.py`, or `OPy-Config.py` and that's it.

**Final Note**
 * If the OBD PID Master CSV gets updated, it can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ch2tyRrUQ67ai9sxeU1pBr5s8Qz32EOzjVaoeCC4ZqE/edit?usp=sharing). Just make sure to not rename the file.
